## Windows_Wifi_Credential_Collector v2

## This is a simple python program which collects saved wifi passwords and copies them to a json format in a tidy manner.
## This script only works on Windows.

## Pre-requisites: Python3 should be installed on the windows machine.

## Usage:python3 wifi_pass.py

## The credentials of the saved Wifi password will be available in json file in the same directory where the script has ran.
## Major changes made to the code compared to the old one, which was quite inefficent way.

## Will update the functionality of this script to send the outfile to an email or discord bot (in future).
